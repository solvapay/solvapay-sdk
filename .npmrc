# NPM Publishing Authentication
# 
# Local Development:
#   Use `npm login` - authentication is stored in ~/.npmrc globally
#
# CI/CD (GitHub Actions):
#   The setup-node action automatically configures authentication
#   using the NODE_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable (from NPM_TOKEN secret)
#
# No need to add auth token here - this file is for package configuration only.
