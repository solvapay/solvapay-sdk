# App Description Template

This document describes your application and will be used to customize the generated code, especially the HomePage. You can customize this description before implementing the guides, or use it as-is with the default generic example.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Option 1: Use Default** - Leave this file as-is for a generic purchase SaaS example
